## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Patrick1Rhode/USSDFRAMEWORK/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
if($handler->getSequence()=="0"){
        //
        $handler->setUssd_body("Hello World");
        $handler->setRequest_type("REQUEST");
        $handler->setSequence("1");
        $handler->setEnd_of_session("FALSE");
        echo getResponse($handler);
    }
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
